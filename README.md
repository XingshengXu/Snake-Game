# Snake-Game
Snake is a classic arcade game that has been around for decades. In the game, the player controls a snake that moves across the screen, consuming food items to grow in length. The goal of the game is to grow the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. The game gets progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer, and the player must use quick reflexes and strategy to avoid collisions. Snake is simple to understand but difficult to master, making it a popular choice for gamers of all ages.
