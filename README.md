# Snake-Game

## Introduction
Snake is a classic arcade game that has been around for decades. In the game, the player controls a snake that moves across the screen, consuming food items to grow in length. The goal of the game is to grow the snake as long as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. The game gets progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer, and the player must use quick reflexes and strategy to avoid collisions. Snake is simple to understand but difficult to master, making it a popular choice for gamers of all ages.

## Game Features
1. User-friendly interface: The game is designed with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for players to control the snake and interact with the game.
2. Dynamic snake movement: The snake can move in four different directions (up, down, left, and right) and the body parts of the snake follow the head and preceding body parts.
3. Random food generation: The food items are generated randomly on the game screen, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.
4. Classic background music: The BGM is the classic Snake Game theme music, enjoy!
